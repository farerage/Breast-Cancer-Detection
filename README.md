# Breast-Cancer-Detection

### The dataset is from this link https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

### The Attributes

1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter (mean size of the core tumor)
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

### In this article I will show you how to create your very own machine learning python program to detect breast cancer from data. Breast Cancer (BC) is a common cancer for women around the world, and early detection of BC can greatly improve prognosis and survival chances by promoting clinical treatment to patients early. So itâ€™s amazing to be able to possibly help save lives just by using data, python, and machine learning!
